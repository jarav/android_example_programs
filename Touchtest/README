A port of the equivalent actionscript and Processing collision programs. Here, the configuration of the radius(mass) and the initial velocities of the balls is through touch.
Touch the view to toggle the animation. To configure the velocity and radius(mass) of a ball, first, stop the animation and then touch the ball that you want to configure. Touch and drag the head of the yellow arrow to change the selected ball's initial velocity. Touch and drag the red outer ring to change the radius and hence its mass. To move a ball to another spot, first select the ball by touching and then, without removing that finger, touch the spot you want the ball to move to with another finger(multi-touch).
The animation will not start if the balls overlap with themselves or with the walls.
